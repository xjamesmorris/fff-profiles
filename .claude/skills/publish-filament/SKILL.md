name: publish-filament
description: Publish one or more filament (or process) profiles from the local PrusaSlicer master config bundle into the repo's profiles/ tree. Use when the author wants to extract, package, or release a profile (optionally with a paired process/printer) from their bundle, or regenerate profiles/*.ini.

# Publishing a filament profile

This repo distributes PrusaSlicer profiles as small, individually importable config
bundles under `profiles/<Vendor>/{filament,process}/`, generated from the author's master
bundle by `scripts/extract.py`. Filenames encode printer+slicer and contain no spaces,
e.g. `profiles/3DXTech/filament/3DXLABS_EMI-ABS__PrusaCOREOne_Prusaslicer.ini`. Use this
workflow to publish or update one.

## Guardrails (read first)

- **Never author, tune, or flatten profile values.** The tooling only *selects and
  copies* presets verbatim. Editing temperatures/speeds/flow etc. is the human author's
  job — doing so would break the project's LLM-usage disclosure (see README).
- **The master bundle is local-only and never committed** (`.gitignore` blocks
  `*config_bundle*.ini`). Default path: `../PrusaSlicer_config_bundle.ini`.
- Only commit/push when the author explicitly asks.

## Steps

1. **Find the exact preset name(s).** Names contain spaces/`@`, so list them:
   ```sh
   make list                       # or: python3 scripts/extract.py --source <bundle> --list
   ```
   Ignore scratch presets (`- Copy`, `Calibration`, `simple`, `OLD …`) unless asked.

2. **Add entries to `manifest.json`** (copy from `manifest.example.json` if absent). Each
   filament entry: `name` (exact preset name, required), `vendor` (required — the output
   directory), optional `base` (filename base; derived from the name if omitted), optional
   `print` (paired process) and `printer`. Manifest-level `printer_label`/`slicer_label`
   default to `PrusaCOREOne` / `Prusaslicer`; override per entry if needed. Standalone print
   profiles go in a `processes` list (same fields, minus `print`).

3. **Generate:**
   ```sh
   make publish                    # runs extract.py against manifest.json
   ```

4. **Review the output and any notes.** Each `note: references parent not in bundle …`
   means an ancestor wasn't found and is assumed to be a PrusaSlicer *system* preset. Verify
   that's true — a genuine system preset (e.g. `Generic PETG @COREONE`) is fine, but an
   unexpected name may be a **dangling parent** (a deleted user preset) that makes the export
   incomplete. Fix the master bundle if so.

5. **Sanity-check the file**: it should contain the filament section (plus any included
   parents/print/printer) and **no `[presets]` block**. If you can, import it into
   PrusaSlicer via `File → Import → Import Config Bundle…` to confirm it loads clean.

6. **Validate and test:** `make check` (validator + offline tests; the pre-commit hook runs
   the same on what's staged). Run `make validate-net` to confirm every external parent
   exists in Prusa's system bundle. Report validator findings to the author rather than
   editing profile values. Optionally `make test-net`.

7. Commit the generated `profiles/**/*.ini` **only when asked**, with the
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer. (`manifest.json` is gitignored — local only.)
